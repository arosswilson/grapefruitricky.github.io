  <h2 class="maintext">Takeaways from the Fireside Chat</h2>
  <h4 class="maintext">March 19, 2015</h4>


    <p class="maintext">

      I just watched the <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">fireside chat video</a> from Shereef Bishay on what to expect from DevBootcamp and what you can do to get the most out of it.  To illustrate his pionts, he uses a comparison between a restaurant and kitchen.  People approach restaurants as consumers - they go in, look at the menu, order, eat, and leave. Whereas, if you're in a kitchen, you're working to make something, and if something doesn't seem right you can take control and change it. He wants us to approach Dev Bootcamp with the attitude that we're in the kitchen: to be inspired, to take control, to be mad (he even says "be mad" but he means it in the same sense that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/1742.Jack_Kerouac">Jack Kerouac did in On the Road</a>)and make it as fulfilling as you can! I like that. It's like Nancy (my mother) says, "Listen Rossie, you're only going to get out of this what you put in." I also liked this illustration because when you're in a kitchen you're with a lot of people (as opposed to being stood-up on date in the restaurant).  This invokes the idea of collaboration and the fact that I'm not in this alone, but will be working and growing with the folks next to me.

        Being in this boat with others is a little intimidating because I haven't had any experience with development before this. Additionally I often try to compare my intelligence to others and beome concerned that I might not be on their level. This concern was addressed in the video when Shereef discussed qualities that tend to lead to successful experiences. Some of these qualities were: persistence, empathy, curiousity, and humility. I found that very encouraging because these are all things that I can control and really focus on improving over the prep phase. </p>

      <p>
        I reckon all of this is leading back to to my biggest takeaway from the video: BE HUNGRY! I really like the idea that I control my destiny. All of the sudden I have a lot of resources at my findertips, so who am I to waste them?! I've been waiting for this week to start since September of 2014, and I've known that this is something that I've wanted to try for longer than that! It's time for me to really give this all I can, to ask my questions, to grab the low-hanging fruit then get a ladder and grab that damn high-hanging fruit, to steer this ship, to be wrong (only occasionally and in a graceful manner :-]), and maybe even inspire others!  I know that this is going to be a tough journey and some days will be worse than others, but I'm going to focus on keeping my persistence up and attacking areas that I don't understand. <b>I'm going to focus on staying hungry</b>.
