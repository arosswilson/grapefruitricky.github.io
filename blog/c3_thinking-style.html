  <h1 class="maintext">What Am I Thinking?</h1>
  <h2 class="maintext">A Dangerously Close Look At My Mind</h2>
  <h4 class="maintext">April 4, 2015</h4>


    <p class="maintext">
      The week we learned a little about <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Styles</a> this week, which a cool way of getting some perspective on how we think.  I took a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">quiz</a> which <strike>placed me into my Hogwarts House</strike> rated me in each one of Gregorc's thinking styles and showed me which one I was strongest in. Before I let you know what categroy I'm strongest in, I want to call out a couple of things. Similar to Hogwarts houses, there are four thinking styles and they all have generally good attributes. Another thing to note is many people agree that you're not purely one thinking style.  The quiz is nice because it shows you how high you rate on each. There could be a few thinking styles that work well, and some that maybe just aren't your strength.
    </p>
    <p class="maintext">
        Now for the moment you've all been waiting for: I'm a Concrete Random thinker. After doing a little research, here are some themes I found on what I prefer:
        <ul>
          <li>experimenting/trial and error approach</li>
          <li>hand-on experiences</li>
          <li>producing creative results</li>
          <li>working independently</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="maintext">Here are things I'm not as good with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Meeting timelines</li>
          <li>Keeping detailed records</li>
          <li>Showing how I got an answer</li>
          <li>Accepting when change is impossible</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="maintext">
          When I first got my score, I started to protest it, but after doing some reflection and research, I started to strongly embrace it (the same thing happened when I was placed into House Hufflepuff).  I really do like taking concepts and quickly trying to apply them to see what works. I also enjoy working on things independently - so much so, that I used to get to work very early so I knew that I was alone. I even agree with the the things I'm not good at (although the first two seem like fortune cookie answers in the sense that everyone would probably agree with them).
        </p>
        <p class="maintext">
          After I reflected on these I started to apply these to how DBC is going so far. I think being hands-on and enjoying experimenting are valuable, because it means I want to test out new ideas and concepts. I like trying them quickly to cement my understanding by testing things out and using the trial and error process. I also think the producing creative results strength alludes to thinking about problems creatively. That's helpful because there have been multiple wasy to solve most of the problems we've encountered so far. The creativity helps me look at problems in different ways, which can help me out if I'm having trouble solving them.
        </p>
        <p class="maintext">
          I can also apply this thinking style to my struggles I've had so far at DBC. We typically have about three pairing sessions a week, which have been difficult. Pairing sessions are when two people work together to program; one is typically the drive/typer, and the other is the navigator/person who tries to see the big picture during the session. These have been a struggle because I like to figure things out independently, and sometimes have trouble expressing my thought process. I also have difficulty finishing something in a reasonable timeframe. This hasn't been too big of an issue since DBC is my biggest priority, but it could make things difficult for me when I start on-site in May. To attack these issues, I want to focus on my communication with my pair and make sure he or she understands my thought process. Also, make sure they understand that I like the trial and error method and while I like diving into things, sometimes it's good for them to pull me back and think about them more strategically. I think introducing myself and my thinking style during the routine check-in will help with this.  As far as my time issue, I'm working on time-boxing tasks (see the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>). This has been very helpful when I've stuck to the time alotted, and I think with more practice I can get even better with this.

          Putting plans in place to take on some of these weaknesses can be challenging, but I think it is part of the growing process. I've started to embrace the "growth mindset" that says that you can work on weaknesses and make them better.  This mindset is contradicted by the "fixed mindset" which basically says that you are born with certain strengths and weaknesses and there isn't a lot you can do to change them (see more about Carol Dwecks fixed vs. growth mindset idea <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">here</a>). The growth mindset certainly seems like the more challenging route to take, but the fixed mindset seems a little too complacent to me. That said, if I stick to some of the aforementioned plans, hopefully I can become better at completing things on time and explaining my thought process.

          Since all of you are so interested, I'll give you an update on how this is going in a couple of weeks. Additionally, as always, let me know if you have any feedback! I'd love to hear it - especially if you have an opinion on whether my site home is a better layout than this blog or vice-versa.
