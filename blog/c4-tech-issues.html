      The prompt for our cultural blog this week is to write about a tech issue. I'd like to cover something that I've been pretty close to in my previous job: sharing health data. Let me take a moment to discuss the problem. Everybody's health information is private (most people know and expect that), which is nice because you don't want folks blabbing about some health issue you're dealing with - you want to share it, or not share it on your own terms.  That said, there are times when doctors need to see that information quickly and easily.. Let's say you go to one hospital and have some things done and then you are traveling and all the sudden you need to go to the doctor - most of the time, doctor won't be able to easily get your past health information which could be very impactful on how he/she treats you. I liken this issue to car maintenance: we've all been to get routine maintenance, and there are all those things other than the regular oil change and tire rotation that your car could potentially need. The problem is if you change where you go for maintenance, then they can't tell what you've had done on your car in the past and what should be done to the car now. With both issues you have different healthcare providers, there are many competing health record vendors that must ultimately work together to share data between their systems.

      One of the main goals with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record#Meaningful_use">Meaningful Use</a>, a program that emerged from the Affordable Care Act (FKA Obamacare) was to get all hospitals to use electronic health records, to submit data on the quality of care, and to share health information electronically. Ultimately, the quality data gives the government a way to shift payment for physicians from a fee for service model to a pay for performance model (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_for_performance_%28healthcare%29#Medicare">more info on pay for performance</a>) I won't get into the controversial topic of what the best payment structure is, but many hospital systems have become successful at submitting quality data. What hasn't been as successful has been interoperability and sharing data between systems. Last year there was a big stir in congress about how <a href="http://www.fierceemr.com/story/phil-gingrey-ehr-interoperability-fraud-against-american-taxpayers/2014-07-22">interoperability hasn't been successful</a> and while I disagree with many of the causes and details in that article, the point that interoperability/data sharing isn't as robust as it needs to be is true.

      This is an issue that's very challenging because it's so unique and complex. It's challenging technically for many reasons, but also tough because the solution requires EMR vendors to work together. Technically there are many things that make sharing health information challenging. One is the fact that health data is complex. For example, there are 13,000 diagnosis codes that health care providers can assign to a patient (and soon they're are making a jump to a new set of 68,000 codes) and that's just one small facet of what is documented on a patient. The amount of information that can be documented on patients (that also needs to be stored discreetly for reporting purposes) is truly WILD. Another challenge is connecting patient identifiers from one system to another. I have to call out my friend, TC, who recently wrote <a href="http://blog.redoxengine.com/managing-patient-identifiers/">an awesome post</a> on why patient identifiers are so challenging. This is one of those fun problems where the deeper you dig, the more issues you find. I think that this is only going to become more prominent until it's resolved because easily sharing patient data is a very clear way of improving healthcare.

      I hope this was a fun trip into the wild world of healthcare technology and one of it's hot topic issues. Use those links in the top to let me know if you have any feedback!
