  <h1 class="maintext">Oh no! Feedback!</h1>
  <h2 class="maintext">Feedback and Pairing during Dev Bootcamp</h2>
  <h4 class="maintext">April 19, 2015</h4>


    <p class="maintext">
      Alright sports fans, now I'm going to take a little time to discuss my experience with pairing and feedback at Dev Bootcamp so far. <br>

      <b>Pairing</b><br>
      First of all, pairing is when two people work on a coding project at the same time, they take turns being the 'driver' and 'navigator'. The driver is the one who is actually typing the code and the navigator is the one trying to keep the big picture in mind and make sure the code that's written is following that picture.<br>

      Generally, it's been a lot of fun pairing with others. Starting off, I was nervous, but now that I have gotten used to it, I've started looking forward to these sessions.  My favorite part has been when I pair with someone who knows Ruby better than I do. In those scenarios I tend to be the driver and and they navigate. This gives me a great opportunity to learn about their though process and ask questions about why he or she wants to do something before I actually type it. I also really enjoy solving the problems. There have been a few times where I've started pairing and both of us didn't have a very clear idea of how to approach it. It's fun starting that way and then being able to solve the problem. <br>

      I think communication has typically been the biggest challenge for me while pairing. When I know what I want to do and I'm the navigator, it's difficult for me to say exactly what I want to happen. Often time I get caught up trying to describe the detail and the big picture of what I'm trying to do at the same time. I think this issue is ascerbated by the fact that we do this over video chats. I'm interested to see how this changes once we're all working together in the same room. For my future sessions, this is a good thing for me to bring up as we discuss the navigator role in our sessions. I can try to see if the person I'm pairing with would like me to go through the big picture or the detials first as the navigator. Setting that expectaiton initially will help me approach the role of the navigator.<br>

      <b>Feedback</b><br>
      When we write feedback, we're supposed to make it actionable, specific, and kind. As I read my feedback I was surprised how kind it felt while also being actionable. I think it's easier to make feedback sound kind if it's given face-to-face, but a lot of the other folks seem to be good at it in written words alone! Most of the feedback has been encouraging for me. I think I started closer to the "no knowledge" end of the Ruby knowledge spectrum while a lot of the folks I paired with were more experienced, but things were generally positive on my ability to pick up concepts. One major theme of my feedback is that I need to work communication. I mentioned this earlier, but I do think it would be helpful for me to determine whether my pair likes to hear my big picture idea first or after we get the details in so that will dictate how I navigate. While getting feedback has occasionally been tough, I know that if someone takes time to write it, then it's advantageous for me to digest it and try to work on what they say.<br>

      I think writing feedback is has been a valuable experience for me. At my previous job, feedback was really important and pretty pervasive, so it's been interesting to transition some of my feedback techniques from my previous life to Dev Bootcamp. I think my biggest challenge is to make sure my feedback is actionable. It's really easy to send feedback over the interwebs that's kind, but doesn't have a lot that a person can respond to. Over the next few weeks, this will be my primary focus - to make sure there's a solid piece of actionable feedback.<br>

      <b>Final Thoughts</b><br>
      Overall, I have enjoyed the pairing and feedback aspects. Both have given me an opportunity to get to know a few of the people I'll be working with over the next 3 months. Feedback is challenging to read sometimes and challenging to write, but I like that we're doing it in an environment where it's expected (we each have to write feedback everytime we work with someone). Since it's so regular, it gives me the sense that we're all in this together and striving for the same thing, and this is how we can help each other out. I'm looking forward to using these skills and adapting to the differences once we're actually face-to-face.<br><br>

      Let me know if you have any thoughts or feedback (consider making it actionable, specific, and kind if you do :-)) by using those links at the top.
