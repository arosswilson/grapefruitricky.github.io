  <h1 class="maintext">Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2 class="maintext">What is it? How can we mitigate it?</h2>
  <h4 class="maintext">April 26, 2015</h4>


    <p class="maintext">
      The cultural topic that I'll be addressing today is on stereotype threat. This is the theory that people start to conform to negative stereotypes about their social group. For example, one study found Black freshmen performed more poorly on standardized tests than White freshmen when their race was emphasized than when it wasn't. Most research says that anxiety can cause the reduction in performance. So if negative stereotypes are present for a specific group, a member of that group is likely to become anxious about his or her performance, which in turn will hinder the performance.<br>
      I don't know if I can pinpoint a time that I've felt stereotype threat, but I certainly empathize with it because I get anxious about doing certain things due to my own apprehension and belief that I'm not good enough. I didn't do as well as I wanted to on the last math class I took (8 years ago), so I often criticize my math skills and generally don't have a lot of confidence in them. Stereotype threat would be even worse than that because hypothetically the person experiencing it hasn't shown any signs that they aren't capable for a certain task and might not do as well just because of social stereotypes.<br>
      This is an important subject to think about as I prepare for Dev Bootcamp. I think we can all help each other fight stereotype threats in 3 ways. 1. We can focus on embracing the growth-mindset of intelligence. This is basically that we all are able to improve our intelligence in any area as long as we work at it. 2. We can foster a welcoming/accepting environment at Dev Bootcamp. I think we're doing a pretty good job of that currently but it'll be easier once we're physically in the same location. I think a feeling that everyone belongs and is in the same boat as far as learning web development will go far in reducing stereotype threat. 3 I think if we focus on giving positive feedback as well as actionable, specific, and kind feedback then that can help others. It's amazing how much more confident I feel when someone sends me positive feedback about a specific area.<br>
      That's it for today - let me know if you have an thoughts based on what I said!
