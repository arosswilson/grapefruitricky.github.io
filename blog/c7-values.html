      Last week I discussed stereotype threat, and this week, I'm going to dive-in and discuss more on how affirmation can be used to combat stereotype threat. To refresh your memory, stereotype threat is the theory that people that are part of groups that have stereotypes feel like they're at risk of confirming those stereotypes. It's theorized that affirmation can help combat stereotype threat, which seems logical - confirming to others that they have done something well tends to make them think they are good at that thing. <br>
      Before getting into that though, I'm goign to talk about some values that come to mind when I think of my happiest/proudest times and then discuss how they could potentially help abate stereotype threat. Some values that are important to me are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Loyalty</li>
        <li>Knowledge</li>
        <li>Persistence</li>
        <li>Will-Power</li>
        <li>Integrity</li>
        <li>Self-Respect</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p class="maintext">
      A lot of these have the theme of being 'morally straight' as Boy Scout might say. Integrity, is one of my favorite values, because I think if I can be honest and have strong morals, then I can more easily gain respect with people you work with. Integrity also gives me the confidence that when I have done something, I've done it right, without cutting corners.<br>

      The last time I was hit up for advice, it was a situation where someone wanted to discuss the easy vs. the correct way to do something. I typically try to take the path that I believe is the correct, and morally straight way to do something, but it's easy to consider alternatives. In those cases it's nice to discuss the situation with a friend to get the perspective and encouragement needed to make the correct choice. I think friends will come to me for these situations because they know I typically want to make the 'good' choice.<br>

      I think integrity can help mediate stereotype threat at DBC because if we try to act with integrity, then we will be encouraging to each other.  We will also create an environment where people won't feel like they aren't as good at something just because of a stereotype. I think that this will be important to focus on during our initial weeks at DBC so we can create an environment that encourages creativity and fellowship.
