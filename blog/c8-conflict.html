  <h1 class="maintext"> Conflict</h1>
  <h2 class="maintext">The last time I call my internet service provider.</h2>
  <h4 class="maintext">May 10, 2015</h4>


    <p class="maintext">
      Today, for my cultural portion of the blog, I'm going to describe the last time I had conflict, what the source of the conflict was, what emotions did I feel upon analyzing the conflict, what did I do to resolve the conflict, what I would do differently if I could go back to the situation, and what I learned from it.<br>
      Alright, so I lived with my parents for a couple months inbetween working in Wisconsin and Dev Bootcamp. As a part of that, I tried to take on a few projects around the house to seem like a useful, contributing housemate to my parental unit. One of the projects was to work on the internet connection issues. Generally their internet was slow and doing things like streaming video was basically impossible. I took the basic troubleshooting methods of restarting the modem and making sure everything was connected. After that, I knew it was time to call the internet service provider for support. When I called, I was went through the automated troubleshooting process, which took what seemed like 20 minutes. It was also very basic things it was asking me to check that I had already done, which was frustrating. Finally, after that was over, I spent two hours on the phone with someone who asked me a lot of questions and ultimately wasn't able to help.<br>
      When I started gettiing angry, I realized that it was because I felt that I had done a good job troubleshooting the issue and the only way to get fix the internet speed was to have someone out to the house to replace the modem. I kind of felt like my time was being wasted, but when I started to analyze the situation I realized that the person on the end of the line was doing her job and probably had to go through the questions before sending someone out to help me.<br>
      To resolve this, I decided to work on answering the questions as well as I could so we could move forward with trying to get someone out to the house. If I could go back and go back to that instance, I would try to be more empathetic from the beginning. That would have helped my mood, and it would have probably helped us answer some of the questions more quickly. This situation taught me to try to analyze my emotions early to see what is causing them. If I can take the time to do that, then I can typically find a root cause of why I'm feeling the way I am and revert it.
