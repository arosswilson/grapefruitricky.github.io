      My final cultural post is about questions. How do you ask good questions for issues that you run into? I think I got pretty familiar with this during my last job. The biggest thing about asking questions is to understand is that in general while you are asking a question to get information, it's important to do research on the questions before you ask them. Keep in mind that it takes effort to ask good questions. <br>
      The first thing to do when asking a question is to sum up the issue. This is important if the question is in an email or in a format where you need to give it a title. This helps the folks reading the question quickly get a feel for what the issue is. Next, create a detailed account of what the issue is. It's important to give enough information so other folks can recreate the issue. This allows them to get on the same page because they're seeing the same issue you are. It's also good to sum up things you tried to do to resolve the issue.  That way the person you're sending the issue to doesn't have to repeat those tests. Finally, I think it's good to give clear implications of what the issue are and when it needs to be solved (if there is urgency surrounding it). This will help the person you're sending it to prioritize it.<br>
      All of these things certainly add work to asking questions, having spent some time on both sides of questions, these steps are helpful to solving issues efficiently. Let me know if you have any questions about this post!
