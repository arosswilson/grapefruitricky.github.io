  <h2 class="maintext">A n00b's Take on Version Control, Git, and GitHub</h2>
  <h4 class="maintext">March 18, 2015</h4>


    <p class="maintext">
      <b>What are the benefits of version control?</b></p>
    <p>
      First of all, you may be wondering what version control is. It's basically a system that records changes made to a file or group of files. Developers typically use version control, but the concept should be familiar if you use a word processor like Microsoft Word. Have you been in a situation where you're writing a paper and then your computer crashes or your little brother closes the program to play Candy Crush? Microsoft Word has your last saved version of your paper, which is similar to version control. Version control, however keeps a record of all of your changes so you can easily see the differences and change back to previous versions if needed. The benefit here is that you won't lose your previous work (and you don't have to worry as much about your Candy Crush addicted brother ruining your life). Version control also makes it easy for you to copy current code, make updates to your copy, and merge them when ready. Finally, with the help of GitHub or other web based version control repositories you can easily collaborate with a group on a project at the same time without overwriting each other. It's similar to Dropbox, but used to store all the versions of your project.
    </p>
    <p><b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b></p>
    <p>
      Git is a popular version control system. There are three areas that your updates can be in: working, staged, and commit. At any point, you can use the 'git status' command to see your updates and what area they're in. The working stage means you're currently working on it and aren't ready to save it. You can move things to the staged area (with the command 'git add')when you have finished working on a part of the project (I have recently discovered that I accompany this process with a little jig). Finally, when you are ready to save your files, you move them to commit with the 'git commit -m' command. When using this command you also enter a message about what you're updating and why. Git and other version controls keep a record of all the commits and exactly what was changed ("git log" allows you to see all of your commits). Another thing to note is you can't can't move something from the working area to commit without staging it. This allows developers to be very precise about what they commit each time.
    </p>
    <p><b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b></p>
    <p>
      As I mentioned earlier, GitHub is a web-based version control repository. GitHub makes it easy to store all of the updates you've made on your computer online. At the very least, it's nice to know that your work is backed-up online (because who knows when I'll spill my coffee all over my computer), but there are a few other things that make GitHub really cool. If you're like me and have a lot of friends...-well some friends and you want to work on a project together, then it lets all of you make copies of the project and merge updates without overwriting anything. Additionally, GitHub has become a cool community where people share their development with others. A lot of it is open-source which means you can take and use other people's development. Isn't that cool?! I reckon it's like if I went to my neighbor's house and he made some delicious cookies. Then I had one and thought "wow, these are delectable, but what if I was able to add chocolate chips to these?" My   neighbor then gives me the recipe and tells me to give it a shot. If the neighborhood were able to collaborate on a cookie like that then some good cookies would probably be made. You can collaborate on development like that on GitHub, except your neighborhood is much bigger. Think of the possibilities!
