    <p class="maintext">
      Today I want to reflect on my experience making this blog/website so far. I'll start by covering the site creation aspect. This site was originally created with only HTML and CSS, which are fairly easy things to pick up. It's the kind of thing that's easy to learn but hard to master. I think one of the biggest challenges was initially determining what I wanted the site to look like. I knew it was going to be pretty basic (since it's a blog and not too interactive) but things like the color scheme and placement of text and pictures where challenging. Some of my bigger fans will recall that I actually had two "themes" for my site originally. I ended up removing one that I considered silly and creative, but actually it was just an eyesore. Fortunately my older brother, Eric gave me some feedback on the other theme, so I improved it and decided it was better than the silly theme. While I consider myself to be creative, I'm not very good at making things asthetically pleasing (I mean look at me), but I was pretty satisfied with how the site looked after making updates.<br>
      The other thing that was difficult was making updates to the site on a regular basis. I made a few small asthetic changes as I went on, but nothing major. Part of it was because I didn't solicit enough feedback. I hoped that I would get some by just telling people to send me some at the end of each blog post - that never happened (I certainly don't blame any of my fans out there - it was a passive way to get feedback). One day I was working in my brother's office and got him to give me feedback, which was really helpful. If I had to do this over again, I would try to get feedback more actively.<br>
      While there are challenges to making the site, there were some very rewarding moments. One was just getting the site up initially. It felt like I had actually made something which was really nice! There were also a couple of times where people mentioned that they read a post, which shocked and touched me. In general, it was nice to know that at least some people were reading what I was writing. Thanks everyone!
